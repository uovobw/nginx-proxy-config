A small script to manage a battery of nginx proxies using Flask and bootstrap.
It supports multiple sites per proxy host with and without ssl.
Very crude, should not be used in production.

Requirements:

Flask
paramiko

INSTALLATION

install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

export the configuration location

export AT_CONFIG=/path/to/settings.py

and then run with

python app.py

CONFIGURATION

the configuration is straightforward, the script requires the remote user to either be root
or to be able to write-access the files under /etc/nginx/ (or where nginx is installed)

The service is designed to be rarely updated, so there is no data persistence
layer other than a pickled file that gets re-serialized each time the configuration is
edited. Security was not a concern since the proxy host only runs nginx in an empty
debian installation.

TODO

- improve code quality
- abstract and cleanup models
- add database/storage
- clean up templates and javascript/css
- add multiple remotes to each frontend
